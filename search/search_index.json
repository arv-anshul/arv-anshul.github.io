Regression models tries to create/fit a line in-between the data space, to get the essence of the data and tries to keep the value of loss function minimum as possible. Non-Linearity Tree models can handle both linear and non-linear data. Regression models performs better with linearly separable data but it fails to capture the essence of non-linear data. Computational Complexity Tree models are more complex than linear models, especially training complexity of Ensemble techniques as it finds optimal solution iteratively. Regression models has an upper edge here because it requires find the optimal co-efficient which minimizes the loss function and for that it uses Gradient Descent techniques. Effects of Outliers Tree models are generally robust to outliers because they creates multiple decision boundaries which separates the outliers easily and model doesn't affect much from it. Regression models are highly sensitive to outliers because when the data has outliers the best fit line will try to fit the outliers values to reduce the loss function. To reduce this sensitivity we have Regularization concepts. Handling Null Values Some tree based algorithms/models can handle null values like XGBoost. Linear model can't handle null values at all . Preprocess the data before training linear models. Interpretable Only Decision Trees are interpretable but libraries like SHAP can explain ensemble tree models.

The ML Models get served as API through a FastAPI app.</li> <li>Frontend: Here all the above components meets and work together to show awesome insights on user's uploaded   data. This is a streamlit web app where users can upload their watch history data and see insights. Here above API   services were called to fetch videos details from official YouTube API, to store data in database, to make   predcitions using ML Models, to recommend channels and etc.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Project Architecture: I have created some diagrams to showcase the project's architecture and for that created a    dedicated page.</p> </li> <li> <p>Containerization with Docker: All the three components (Backend API, ML &amp; Frontend) of project were    containerized using docker and used <code>docker compose</code> to wrap all three images in a container.    <code>uv</code> is used to install packages in docker images. <code>mongodb</code> image is used as database for    the project.</p> </li> <li> <p>More in Project: As I am learning MLOps concepts I am trying to implement them in this project because planning    to add DVC and MLFlow into the project.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"project/yt-watch-history/channel_reco/","title":"Channel Recommender System","text":"<p>I've built <code>contentType</code> prediction pipeline using videos titles.
