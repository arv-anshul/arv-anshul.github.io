# Personal Website

[üåê Go To Website!](https://arv-anshul.github.io)

I have build this website using [`mkdocs-material`](https://mkdocs.org).

## Setup Locally

1. Clone this repository with `git`:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/arv-anshul/arv-anshul.github.io
    ```

2. Create a virtual environemt in the cloned directory, then install requirements from `requirements.txt` file using `pip` command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Now, you can easily serve the `docs/` folder as a website using `mkdocs` commands:

    ```bash
    mkdocs serve
    ```

4. Optional, if you want to render all the `.md` as `.html`, `.css` and `.js` scripts, then run:

    ```bash
    mkdocs build
    ```

## Acknowledgement
