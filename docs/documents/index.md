# Documents

!!! quote
    Whichever projects project I built, first I discuss it with myself using a document where I put project related references, conventions, problems, doubts, solution and more because this helps me to focus on my project while building it.

This tab mostly contains ðŸ”– stuffs like related to ðŸ’» my projects. You can my project's documents from the sidebar.
