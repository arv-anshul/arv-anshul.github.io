## Requirements

| Requirements          | Description                                              | Extra                                                                                          |

| Job Opening Data      | Jobs where agent will apply                              | Maybe agent will fetch data on-the-go by web scraping.                                         |
| User Login (LinkedIn) | Need to login the user on the platform in order to apply |                                                                                                |

## Agent Workflow

- **LinkedIn Profile Scraper:** Scrape LinkedIn profile of user and get relevant info.
- **Parse User's Resume:** Parse info from user's Resume.
- **Retrive relevant jobs:** On the basis of user's parsed info agent will retrive relevant jobs for user after
  analyzing jobs' description.

## Problems

### Applying to Jobs in behalf of user.

If we are going to implement this then this might be the most heavy situation because we have to deal with multiple
steps like:

1. User Login.
2. Migrating to each job listing page.
3. Applying to job by filling the form including uploading user's Resume.

{==

Due to this problem we should **first focus on creating an AI agent which find relevant jobs for user** by seeing their
LinkedIn profile and their Resume.

==}

## Agent Flow

- Linkedin profile URL.
- Resume as PDF
- A tool will extract info like experience, job type, job mode, and more.
- A tool will scrape relevant jobs on the basis of user's extracted data.
- Sort the scraped jobs by most relevant for user.

### LangChain Perception

- How to use messages? (With .stream method)
- How to implement async tools? (For profile scraping and resume parsing purpose)

# ðŸ”Ž Job Finder - Raycast Note

## Current Plan

We planned to provided a platform where both Employee and Employer list their skills and requirements and then we will provide a interface where both Employee and Employer will finder their match on the basis of their skills and requirements.

## Problem *(with Current Plan)*

- As we are no one who is going to use product the idea Employer listing is hard to be gain success on, so I decided to to drop it. *(read next)*
- We can scrape websites like LinkedIn, Naukri, etc. and gather data related to Jobs and make the platform only for Employee *(as name suggests ****Job Finder****).*

## Platform Usage

- User will upload its Resume/CV on our website.
- We will parse their CV using OCR and extract a structure information for our usecase.
- We will then asks the user to fill a partially filled form to get full info about the user.
- The form is already filled by the info we extracted from userâ€™s CV.
- Then, we will recommend most similar Jobs we got in our database.

## Future Plans

- We may also provide a service to create a resume by filling a simple form.
