Docker is a platform designed to simplify the process of creating, deploying, and managing applications using containers. Containers enable developers to package an application with all its dependencies into a standardized unit for seamless deployment across different environments.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Components of Docker

## `Dockerfile`

A `Dockerfile` serves as a blueprint for building Docker images, which are the executable packages containing everything needed to run an application - code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Let's break down the components of a `Dockerfile` and its significance in the context of Docker:

### Context on Dockerfile

1. **Foundation of Image Creation:** A `Dockerfile` specifies a sequence of instructions to assemble an image. It starts with a base image (e.g., Ubuntu, Alpine Linux, Python) and then layers additional configurations and dependencies on top of it.

2. **Clear and Reproducible Build Process:** Each instruction in the `Dockerfile` represents a step in the image-building process. These steps are executed in order, and Docker caches intermediate layers, facilitating faster subsequent builds and ensuring consistency across environments.

3. **Key Components of a Dockerfile:**

   - **Base Image:** Specifies the starting point for the image.
   - **Environment Setup:** Includes commands to install packages, set environment variables, copy files into the image, etc.
   - **Application Configuration:** Defines how the application should be configured inside the container.
   - **Startup Commands:** Specifies the command to execute when the container starts.

### Comprehensive Description of a Dockerfile

A typical `Dockerfile` consists of several sections:

1. **FROM:** Defines the base image. It's the starting point for the image build and often references an official or custom base image from a registry (e.g., `FROM python:3.11-slim`).

2. **WORKDIR:** Sets the working directory inside the container where subsequent commands will be executed.

3. **COPY/ADD:** Copies files or directories from the host machine into the container's filesystem. This includes application code, configuration files, etc.

4. **RUN:** Executes commands during the image build process. Typically used for installing dependencies, setting up the environment, and other preparatory tasks.

5. **ENV:** Sets environment variables within the container. These can define runtime configurations or paths.

6. **EXPOSE:** Informs Docker that the container listens on specific network ports at runtime.

7. **CMD/ENTRYPOINT:** Specifies the command that should be run when the container starts. `CMD` is used to provide default arguments for the `ENTRYPOINT` command, while `ENTRYPOINT` sets the primary command.

#### An Example Dockerfile of a Python Project

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.10

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the required files and directory into the container at /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

# Run main.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

```bash
# Build docker container
docker build -t my_python_container .

# Run docker image
docker run -it my_python_container
```

### Importance and Benefits:

- **Portability:** Dockerfiles enable developers to create consistent environments, ensuring that applications run identically across various systems and environments.

- **Reproducibility:** By capturing all dependencies and configurations in the Dockerfile, developers can replicate the same environment for development, testing, and production.

- **Scalability and Efficiency:** Docker's containerization allows for quick scaling and resource efficiency, enabling applications to be deployed and managed easily.

!!! summary

    A `Dockerfile` is the backbone of Docker-based applications, providing a clear, reproducible, and scalable approach to building containerized applications. It defines the entire setup and configuration needed to run an application within a container, promoting consistency and ease of deployment across different environments.

## :simple-gnubash: `docker`

#### 1. `docker run`

- **Description:** Starts a new container from an image.
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  docker run -it --name my_container ubuntu:latest
  ```
  - `-it`: Starts an interactive terminal within the container.
  - `--name my_container`: Names the container as "my_container".
  - `ubuntu:latest`: Specifies the image to use (latest Ubuntu image).

#### 2. `docker ps`

- **Description:** Lists running containers.
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```
  This command shows the containers' IDs, names, status, ports, and images.

#### 3. `docker images`

- **Description:** Lists available images.
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  docker images
  ```
  Displays a list of all downloaded Docker images along with their tags and sizes.

#### 4. `docker build`

- **Description:** Builds an image from a Dockerfile.
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  docker build -t my_image:latest .
  ```
  - `-t my_image:latest`: Tags the image as "my_image" with the "latest" tag.
  - `.`: Specifies the build context (current directory) containing the Dockerfile.

#### 5. `docker stop`

- **Description:** Stops a running container.
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  docker stop my_container
  ```
  Stops the container named "my_container".

#### 6. `docker start`

- **Description:** Starts a stopped container.
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  docker start my_container
  ```
  Starts the container named "my_container" that was stopped.

#### 7. `docker rm`

- **Description:** Removes one or more containers.

These commands form the core of Docker usage for managing containers, images, building, starting/stopping containers, and interacting with containerized applications. They're essential for everyday Docker workflows in development, testing, and deployment scenarios.

## `.dockerignore`

`.dockerignore` is a file used to specify which files and directories to exclude when building a Docker image. It works similarly to `.gitignore` but for Docker. When building an image, Docker uses this file to determine which files should not be included in the context sent to the Docker daemon, thus reducing the image size and build time.

### Example

An `.dockerignore` file might contain entries like `node_modules`, `*.log`, or any other files/directories that are not necessary for the image build process.

```bash title=".dockerignore"
# Byte-compiled files
__pycache__
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd

# Virtual environments
venv/
env/
.venv/

# Editor/IDE specific files
.vscode/
.idea/
*.sublime-project
*.sublime-workspace

# Logs and temp files
*.log
logs/
*.tmp

# Miscellaneous
.DS_Store
node_modules/
.cache/

# My custom files for practicing
*.arv
arv.*
```

### Differences between `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore`

<figure markdown>

|            Aspect | `.gitignore`                     | `.dockerignore`                                   |
| ----------------: | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
|           Purpose | Specifies files to ignore in Git | Specifies files to exclude in Docker image builds |
|   Associated tool | Git                              | Docker                                            |
|     File behavior | Excludes files in Git operations | Excludes files during image build                 |
|            Impact | Affects version control only     | Affects image build process                       |
|          Use case | Manages repository content       | Manages files in Docker context                   |
| Ignoring patterns | Glob patterns, file names        | Glob patterns, file names                         |

</figure>

`.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` serve different purposes despite their similar naming conventions. While both control what files should be ignored/excluded, `.gitignore` operates within version control systems, allowing certain files not to be tracked. Conversely, `.dockerignore` is used during image building to exclude unnecessary files from the Docker context sent to the daemon, optimizing the image build process.

> Both files use similar syntax (like glob patterns) to specify what should be ignored, but their impact and contexts in which they're utilized differ significantly.
