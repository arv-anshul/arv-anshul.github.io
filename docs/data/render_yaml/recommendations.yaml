      The first movie I've watched in the English language (with concentration) was an

      First time I realize Why K-Drama is so addictive! I am just hooked with this series.

      Each episodes were from different person's perspective which makes it more thrilling to watch.

      Don't judge this series on the name of it "Moving" (Who think this?).

      Amazing experience, it transfers you to vilages of Bihar (literally).
      Best movie where feminism is addressed in a way that you will understand what
      they want to say. Social Commentary, Feminism, Comic Timing, Discipline and more.

      I just feel the love between them in the last scene. See how to live with burden
      to feel love toward someone (here applied on both). Very Slow But Practical.
      I want to watch again. It has only one song it is one of my favorite.
