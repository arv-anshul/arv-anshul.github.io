      The first movie I've watched in the English language (with concentration) was an

      First time I realize Why K-Drama is so addictive! I am just hooked with this series.

      Each episodes were from different person's perspective which makes it more thrilling to watch.

      Don't judge this series on the name of it "Moving" (Who think this?).

      Amazing experience, it transfers you to vilages of Bihar (literally).
      Best movie where feminism is addressed in a way that you will understand what
      they want to say. Social Commentary, Feminism, Comic Timing, Discipline and more.

      I just feel the love between them in the last scene. See how to live with burden
      to feel love toward someone (here applied on both). Very Slow But Practical.
      I want to watch again. It has only one song it is one of my favorite.

      You feel emotion from a very different perspective. It feels very slow and senseless in first
      part but after interval it is gem (full of philosophies and emotions). And in the last you'll
      cry. (पतले मानस)

      My favorite superhero show. All three seasons are masterpiece. Top notch action choreography,
      villian's storyline and I don't want to talk about Charlie Cox's performance. While watching
      this I feel that I will'be this :ninja:

      Sad but full of positivity. Its like art film. Deeply touching emotions. Best performance by
      lead-actor. Favorite character is **Liz** because she supports cares and understand her friend
      in the most difficult time.

      Intense tragic japanese family drama. Honestly, I couldn't understand much why are the

      around it but couldn't found any.

      Engaging thriller with amazing performance by Vijay Sethupathi. As the mystery unfolds you
      just praises the writer. When you find the actual truth you'll CRY; really.
