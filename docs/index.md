    Hey, I am Anshul Raj Verma and I am a Data Scientist. I am Learning ML, NLP and MLOps and also building projects which helps me to grow and learn from mistakes which I have done during building the project.

## Python

I have been {++learning Python since 3 years++} and I have learned so many concepts and terms in it that makes me a good progammer who can understand the errors, debug the codebases and more.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :simple-python: **OOPS** concepts.
- :simple-python: **Async Programming** with FastAPI.
- :simple-pydantic: **Pydantic** for Data Handling/Validation.
- :simple-streamlit: **Streamlit** for creating web-applications.
- :simple-fastapi: **FastAPI** for creating Async REST APIs.
- :simple-pytest: **PyTest** for unit-testing the whole project.
- :simple-materialformkdocs: **MkDocs** for documentation creation.

## Data Science

I have been {++learning Data Science since 3 years++}, using this I am able to explore and exract information from datasets. Learned concepts like ^^EDA^^{ title="Exploratry Data Analysis" }, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Feature Extraction, etc.
In my Data Science journey I've also learned many python libraries like [:simple-numpy: `numpy`](https://numpy.org/doc/), [:simple-pandas: `pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/), [:simple-polars: `polars`](https://pola.rs), etc.

## Machine Learning

Learning Machine Learning along with Data Science. In ML I've encountered various Ml algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, KMeans and many more. ^^Whatever I learned^^, I've implemented them in my projects and checked which algorithm gives me the best results and whoever passes the tuning gets selected for futher predictions :robot:.

### ML Projects

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

  - :simple-youtube:{ .lg .middle } **YouTube Watch Histroy Analyser**

    ---

    Using your youtube watch history data this app will show you some interesting insights about you like which type of content you prefer to watch and more.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: GitHub](https://github.com/arv-anshul/yt-watch-history)

  - :fontawesome-solid-building:{ .lg .middle } **Indian Real Estate Analysis and Price Prediction**

    ---

    I have scrapped and used [99acres.com](https://99acres.com)'s data to create this project through which you can understand the underlying insights about real estate of a Indian City.

## MLOps

I'm currently learning **MLOps**, which helps me to ready my projects for deployment on cloud or anywhere to make prediction with my trained model from anywhere. However, I have only learned :simple-mlflow: MLFlow, :simple-githubactions: GitHub Actions and :simple-docker: Docker for now but I am also exploring many different tools like ~~K8s~~, ~~Seldon~~, etc.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :simple-githubactions: **GitHub Actions** CI/CD
- :simple-docker: **Docker** Containerization, Volumes, Networks
- :simple-mlflow: **MLFlow** Experiment Tracking, Monitoring
