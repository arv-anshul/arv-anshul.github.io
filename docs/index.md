## Python

I have been learning **`python`** since 3 years and I have learned so many concepts and terms in it that makes me a good progammer who can understand the errors, debug the codebases and more.

### What I know in python?

1.  I know OOPS concepts in python language through I am able to create some good projects around Data Science using it.
2.  I know Async Programming in python at a intermidiate level. I used this concept while creating REST APIs using FastAPI framework.
3.  I know Frameworks/Libraries like

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :simple-streamlit: **Streamlit** for creating web-applications.
- :simple-fastapi: **FastAPI** for creating Async REST APIs.
- :simple-pytest: **PyTest** for unit-testing the whole project.
- :simple-materialformkdocs: **MkDocs** for documentation creation.

## Data Science

I have been learning Data Science since 2 years, using this I am able to explore and exract information from datasets. Learned concepts like EDA (Exploratry Data Analysis), Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Feature Extraction, etc.
In Data Science journey I have also learned many python libraries like [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/doc/), [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/), [`polars`](https://pola.rs), etc.

## Machine Learning

I am learning Machine Learning along with Data Science. In Machine Learning, I have encountered various Ml algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, KMeans and many more. Whatever I learned, I implements in my projects and checks which algorithm gives me the best results and whoever passes the tuning get selected for futher predictions üßê.

### Projects where I have used ML Models

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

  - :simple-youtube:{ .lg .middle } **YouTube Watch Histroy Analyser**

    ---

    Using your youtube watch history data this app will show you some interesting insights about you like which type of content you prefer to watch and more.

  - :fontawesome-solid-building:{ .lg .middle } **Indian Real Estate Analysis and Price Prediction**

    ---

    I have scrapped and used [99acres.com](https://99acres.com)'s data to create this project through which you can understand the underlying insights about real estate of a Indian City.

## MLOps

I am currently learning this section **MLOps**, which helps me to ready my projects for deployment on cloud or anywhere to make prediction with my trained model from anywhere. However, I have only learned MLFlow, GitHub Actions and Docker for now but I am also exploring many different tools like K8s, Seldon, etc.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :simple-githubactions: **GitHub Actions** CI/CD
- :simple-docker: **Docker** Containerization, Volumes, Networks
- :simple-mlflow: **MLFlow** Experiment Tracking, Monitoring
