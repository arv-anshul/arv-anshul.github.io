## What ~~I followed~~{: .secondary } to know?

!!! important

    1. As I am learning Python, Data Science and Machine Learning for more than 3 years. I don't have to look around to
       learn new things to build this. _This part is kind of easy for me._{: .secondary }
    2. But as I said earlier, the documentations and ChatGPT is most important resources you can onto. :wink:

- Need to **get an API key from Google Developer Console** to interact with YouTube Data API.
- Need to create an account on DagsHub to store/track MLFlow experiments and models.
- Created a DVC pipeline to run the MLFlow experiments seemlessly using `dvc repro` command.
- After creating the FastAPI app, I've used `pytest` to test it and also setup a `pre-commit` for it.
- Deployment on [render.com](https://render.com).

## What type of problems I have faced?

### :simple-render: Render.com

- As I have used `uv` to manage my project but render.com doesn't support `uv` out-of-the-box so I have used `pip` to
  use `uv` for dependencies installation.

    ```bash
    pip install uv && uv sync --extra=backend --compile-bytecode
    ```

- Also, render.com only serve apps on port under `$PORT` env (which `10000` most of the times) so make sure to
  explicitly provide while running app through `uvicorn` or `fastapi-cli` CLI.

    ```bash
    # For uvicorn
    uvicorn run --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT backend.app:app

    # For fastapi-cli
    fastapi run --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT backend/app.py
    ```

### :simple-docker: Docker

- I am using `wordcloud` to create a plot in a FastAPI route. While building docker image FROM `python:3.11-slim` image, I am getting error because `wordcloud` package needs `gcc` package to build wheels. So you need to explicitly install `gcc` before install `wordcloud` as python package.

    ```dockerfile
    # Install gcc for wordcloud
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y gcc && apt-get clean

    # Now install project dependencies including wordcloud
    # ...
    ```

- Also use multi-stage builds in `Dockerfile` to reduce the image size.
  [See `uv` docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/docker/).
