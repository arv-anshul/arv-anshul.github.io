## What I followed?

!!! important

    1. Documentation is the most important resource for your learning and I followed it thoroughly.
    2. Took help of :simple-openai: ChatGPT to solve bugs and asked questions related to these frameworks/tools.

- Followed [only one YouTube video](https://youtu.be/VeNfHj6MhgA) to learn :simple-vuedotjs: VueJs.
- Used [shadcn/vue](https://shadcn-vue.com) as components library. _Just followed the docs._{: .secondary }
- Whole [`build_frontend.yaml`]() Github Action workflow written by ChatGPT, isn't it amazing :exploding_head:.

Although, I didn't have much knowledge of Vue, Vite and ShadCN like frameworks/tools but their documentations and
ChatGPT helped me so much that I am able to **learn, build, diagnose and deploy** the frontend in almost 2-3 days.

Yes, some credits goes my past knowledge of programming because that's why I able to figure out how do things works and
how handle them by doing right things.

## What type of problems I have faced?

> **हे भगवान!** While learning and working on this frontend project, sometime I get messed up with very silly typo
> mistakes in JavaScript.

The things you are building happily in local will totally change when you are trying to deploy it and I have faced this
too :cry:.

- While deciding how to setup proxy in Docker because I've setup it using Vite and it works like charm in local but
  while writing `Dockerfile` I am able to figure out the solution.
    - Proxy is used in [VueJs YouTube video](https://youtu.be/VeNfHj6MhgA) and thats why I have followed it.
    - [See this docs](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-proxy)
