!!! question "How to get my Spotify data?"

## Some Awesome Insights

To gather insights from `json` files I've used :simple-polars: [`polars`](https://pola.rs) and thier builtin `.plot` accessor which uses [`hvplot`](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/) library under-the-hood.

> See the :simple-jupyter: [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/arv-anshul/notebooks/tree/main/yt-watch-history) to see all the insights.
